data source come from 2 different kaggle users, however due to the size of them, the original data are not included in this repo, here is the link to both of the original data source:

    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abaghyangor/fake-news-dataset
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stevenpeutz/misinformation-fake-news-text-dataset-79k

The csv files in data folder are the pre-processed datas from the original data owners above, and the dataprocess file contain the code logic that separates them up.

model-Ouput only contains the inference result from 4 models of the project, this is because the size of the model weights are too large to be uploaded here, the compressed version of pre-merged lora weight is already above 100mb and the merged final weights are above GB, thus they are not included here.

For further details regarding each file please see the final report.
